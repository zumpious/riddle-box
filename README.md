# RiddleBox: Interactive Pub Quiz Minigames

Welcome to **RiddleBox**, a collection of interactive minigames and riddles designed to add a fun twist to your events, quizzes, or gatherings. Starting with the original "9 Lamps" riddleâ€”a logic puzzle that challenges players to turn on the right combination of lampsâ€”this repository aims to grow into a box full of creative challenges. The second game, "Color Code Guesser," challenges players to deduce a hidden color sequence using logic and feedback from each guess.

Perfect for pub quizzes, team-building activities, or just a fun evening with friends!
